# App Icons

You need to create two PNG icons for the PWA:

- `icon-192.png` (192x192px)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512px)

## How to Create Icons

1. Use any design tool (Figma, Canva, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Create a square canvas (512x512px)
3. Design your icon (suggestion: green background with white pickleball paddle)
4. Export as PNG at 512x512px and save as `icon-512.png`
5. Resize to 192x192px and save as `icon-192.png`
